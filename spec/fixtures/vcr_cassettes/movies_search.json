The HBO showing contained most of the known deleted scenes, thereby lengthening the runtime of the Epic from its video release to 423 minutes.\",\"popularity\":1.254,\"poster_path\":\"/DGCsKaQgcp4QkX7ulL1BMbkIkr.jpg\",\"release_date\":\"1981-03-24\",\"title\":\"The Godfather 1901–1959: The Complete Epic\",\"video\":true,\"vote_average\":10.0,\"vote_count\":1},{\"adult\":false,\"backdrop_path\":null,\"genre_ids\":[],\"id\":526803,\"original_language\":\"en\",\"original_title\":\"Fred: The Godfather of British Crime\",\"overview\":\"This is an examination into the psyche of former London gangster Freddie Foreman: 85 years old, allegedly responsible for multiple murders, and nearing the end of his life. Fred is the only gangster who lived through the turbulent history of the British underworld and survived to tell the tale.\",\"popularity\":1.946,\"poster_path\":\"/eNIE8eB38KAjZuye58wXFDJP79n.jpg\",\"release_date\":\"2018-04-20\",\"title\":\"Fred: The Godfather of British Crime\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":7.2,\"vote_count\":6},{\"adult\":false,\"backdrop_path\":\"/7qKkAKYhnIqZMQ9hWVUZ1zV6kLb.jpg\",\"genre_ids\":[80],\"id\":260872,\"original_language\":\"it\",\"original_title\":\"I contrabbandieri di Santa Lucia\",\"overview\":\"A revolution in Iran halts a heroin shipment, but an alliance of crime families is set on getting it to the US.

Unlike the miniseries, which was presented in four segments (each with opening and closing credits), the Epic is presented as a single segment. In January 2016, HBO aired the Epic in its uncut and uncensored format, later making it available on its streaming platforms. The HBO showing contained most of the known deleted scenes, thereby lengthening the runtime of the Epic from its video release to 423 minutes.\",\"popularity\":1.254,\"poster_path\":\"/DGCsKaQgcp4QkX7ulL1BMbkIkr.jpg\",\"release_date\":\"1981-03-24\",\"title\":\"The Godfather 1901–1959: The Complete Epic\",\"video\":true,\"vote_average\":10.0,\"vote_count\":1},{\"adult\":false,\"backdrop_path\":null,\"genre_ids\":[],\"id\":526803,\"original_language\":\"en\",\"original_title\":\"Fred: The Godfather of British Crime\",\"overview\":\"This is an examination into the psyche of former London gangster Freddie Foreman: 85 years old, allegedly responsible for multiple murders, and nearing the end of his life. Fred is the only gangster who lived through the turbulent history of the British underworld and survived to tell the tale.\",\"popularity\":1.946,\"poster_path\":\"/eNIE8eB38KAjZuye58wXFDJP79n.jpg\",\"release_date\":\"2018-04-20\",\"title\":\"Fred: The Godfather of British Crime\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":7.2,\"vote_count\":6},{\"adult\":false,\"backdrop_path\":\"/7qKkAKYhnIqZMQ9hWVUZ1zV6kLb.jpg\",\"genre_ids\":[80],\"id\":260872,\"original_language\":\"it\",\"original_title\":\"I contrabbandieri di Santa Lucia\",\"overview\":\"A revolution in Iran halts a heroin shipment, but an alliance of crime families is set on getting it to the US.

Unlike the miniseries, which was presented in four segments (each with opening and closing credits), the Epic is presented as a single segment. In January 2016, HBO aired the Epic in its uncut and uncensored format, later making it available on its streaming platforms. The HBO showing contained most of the known deleted scenes, thereby lengthening the runtime of the Epic from its video release to 423 minutes.\",\"popularity\":1.254,\"poster_path\":\"/DGCsKaQgcp4QkX7ulL1BMbkIkr.jpg\",\"release_date\":\"1981-03-24\",\"title\":\"The Godfather 1901–1959: The Complete Epic\",\"video\":true,\"vote_average\":10.0,\"vote_count\":1},{\"adult\":false,\"backdrop_path\":null,\"genre_ids\":[],\"id\":526803,\"original_language\":\"en\",\"original_title\":\"Fred: The Godfather of British Crime\",\"overview\":\"This is an examination into the psyche of former London gangster Freddie Foreman: 85 years old, allegedly responsible for multiple murders, and nearing the end of his life. Fred is the only gangster who lived through the turbulent history of the British underworld and survived to tell the tale.\",\"popularity\":1.946,\"poster_path\":\"/eNIE8eB38KAjZuye58wXFDJP79n.jpg\",\"release_date\":\"2018-04-20\",\"title\":\"Fred: The Godfather of British Crime\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":7.2,\"vote_count\":6},{\"adult\":false,\"backdrop_path\":\"/7qKkAKYhnIqZMQ9hWVUZ1zV6kLb.jpg\",\"genre_ids\":[80],\"id\":260872,\"original_language\":\"it\",\"original_title\":\"I contrabbandieri di Santa Lucia\",\"overview\":\"A revolution in Iran halts a heroin shipment, but an alliance of crime families is set on getting it to the US.

The HBO showing contained most of the known deleted scenes, thereby lengthening the runtime of the Epic from its video release to 423 minutes.\",\"popularity\":1.254,\"poster_path\":\"/DGCsKaQgcp4QkX7ulL1BMbkIkr.jpg\",\"release_date\":\"1981-03-24\",\"title\":\"The Godfather 1901–1959: The Complete Epic\",\"video\":true,\"vote_average\":10.0,\"vote_count\":1},{\"adult\":false,\"backdrop_path\":null,\"genre_ids\":[],\"id\":526803,\"original_language\":\"en\",\"original_title\":\"Fred: The Godfather of British Crime\",\"overview\":\"This is an examination into the psyche of former London gangster Freddie Foreman: 85 years old, allegedly responsible for multiple murders, and nearing the end of his life. Fred is the only gangster who lived through the turbulent history of the British underworld and survived to tell the tale.\",\"popularity\":1.946,\"poster_path\":\"/eNIE8eB38KAjZuye58wXFDJP79n.jpg\",\"release_date\":\"2018-04-20\",\"title\":\"Fred: The Godfather of British Crime\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":7.2,\"vote_count\":6},{\"adult\":false,\"backdrop_path\":\"/7qKkAKYhnIqZMQ9hWVUZ1zV6kLb.jpg\",\"genre_ids\":[80],\"id\":260872,\"original_language\":\"it\",\"original_title\":\"I contrabbandieri di Santa Lucia\",\"overview\":\"A revolution in Iran halts a heroin shipment, but an alliance of crime families is set on getting it to the US.
